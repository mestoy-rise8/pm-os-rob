## 🎯 Context

Built by Michael Estoy for Rob Monroe based on the **Dec 18, 2025 PM Practice Office Hours** discussion about getting FigJam VSM data into Claude.

### The Convergence

Rob built the **workshop tool** (FigJam templates with 3-pass VSM approach).
Michael built the **operating system** (structured data layer for AI analysis).

Neither knew the other was working on this. The work converged because both understood the same problem: **trapped knowledge**.

## 🔬 Research Foundation

PM OS is backed by:
- 11 interviews with Rise8 Risers
- Frictionless Framework (effort vs. output)
- 64% Champion conversion rate data
- 5 friction types identified

## 🤝 Let's Collaborate

These prototypes demonstrate the concept. The real value comes from pairing on the integration.
